# Tweetrends

Perform sentiment analysis on Tweets to map public sentiment about particular topics by location.

This was a proof-of-concept application that was submitted at the SEECS Social Hackathon (SSH). The idea was awarded *2nd position* and a cash award. It was positively received by the audience.

This proof-of-concept uses Stanford's NLP library to process a pre-downloaded set of Tweets and get statistics from that.
